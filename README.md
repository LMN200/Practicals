# GEOG5995M - Assignment 1

This repository contains the 9 practicals associated with the GEOG5995M module for assignment 1. These practicals are all written in Python and have been designed and run in Spyder. 

Each practical folder contains a model, with practicals e to j also containing an agentframework. The agentframework must be run before running the model. 

Each practical builds on the skills learnt in the previous to add to the model and shrink the code, so essentially all 9 model and agentframework files are the same from practical a to j yet get more advanced/enhanced. 

### The Model:
The final model is an agent based model (ABM) where agents (sheep) move, eat, share and breed. The agents have been assigned as either rams (males) or not rams (females referred to as both ewes and agents) in order to faciliate breeding. 

The model can be adapted to change the number of inital agents, breeding distance, sharing distance, agent and ram movement speed, the probability of breeding, and iterations. The stopping conditon can also be increased. Large ram is recommended if increasing the stopping condition. 

Please Note: The model uses Tkinter to run and therefore the backend of python graphics needs to be changed into Tkinter to run properly. 

### Learning Materials:
The assignment uses the following learning materials where most of the code is derived from:
