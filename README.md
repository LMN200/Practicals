# GEOG5995M - Assignment 1

This repository contains the 9 practicals associated with the GEOG5995M module for assignment 1. These practicals are all written in Python and have been designed and run in Spyder. 

Each practical folder contains a model, with practicals e to j also containing an agentframework. The agentframework must be run before running the model. 

Each practical builds on the skills learnt in the previous to add to the model and shrink the code, so essentially all 9 model and agentframework files are the same from practical a to j yet get more advanced/enhanced.
